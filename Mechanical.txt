Abstract: We have investigated the phase equilibria in tAE )BaCuO/ Ag systems, the influence of Ag on the processing of (AE )BaCuO/ Ag composites and the resulting properties. YBaCuO / Ag composites have been grown by the modified melt crystallization process with YBa ZCu 30 " YZ03" Pt and AgzO in the precursor. The improved strength of the YBaCuO lAg composites compared with the conventional YBaCuO bulk material permitted us to magnetize these materials to achieve trapped fields up to 16 T (at 24 K) in the gap of a mini-magnet. The investigation of the microstructure revealed a remarkable increase of the spacing between micro-cracks especially of those perpendicular to alb-planes when 12 wt% Ag was added. In the case of 5mBaCuO / Ag composites, Ag has a strong influence on processing and causes interactions between RE123 seeds and the sample. We show the growth of single-grain 5mBaCuO/ Ag composites in air and discuss the influence of post-annealing on increasing T« and J c • Furthermore, YBaCuO lAg composites have been shown to be appropriate materials used as a solder to join large single grains to large arrays or to "repair" grain boundaries in arrays grown by a multiseeding technique. Introduction The interest in the influence of Ag on the behavior of cuprate superconductors arose already in the early stage of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) research. One can define at least 3 different motivations to investigate interactions between Ag and cuprates .lowering the liquidification temperature; mechanical reinforcement of ceramic or bulk materials;changing intrinsic properties of the super-conducting phase. Attempts  to  prepare  extended  superconducting tapes consisting of YBalCu3()7(YI23) on Ag alloys began in 1993, after it had been found that the peritectic decomposition temperature of Y123 can be depressed below the melting temperature of AgPd alloys in reduced oxygen partial pressureCl J• On the other hand, composite ceramics of polycrystalline Y123 with Ag have been shown to appear less brittle than the polycrystalline sintered Y123 body, resulting in increased fracture toughness and strength<:. The mechanical properties, indeed, revealed to be a crucial limitation to achieve very high trapped fields in bulk Y123-based superconducting materials Csuperconducting permanent magnets )[6,7]. The large Lorentz forces during magnetizing YBaCuO cylinders in fields of 10 T or more cause fatal cracking of the melt textured material. Therefore, the improvement of mechanical properties in a composite material, which contains ductile Ag inclusions, was the starting idea for intensive work on YBaCuO/Ag composite materials. In this paper the role of Ag in improving mechanical properties will be emphasized and the influence of Ag on phase formation will be discussed in more details with YBaCuO/Ag as an example.Later on, a flux containing Ag was applied to grow (RE)1+xBa2-xCu307 (RE123) based bulk materials with large rare earth (RE) ions, the processing of which proved to be complicated due to high peritectic temperatures for these compounds since no appropriate seeding material was available. It was shown by Ikuta et a1. [2J that an adapted growth process in a controlled oxygen atmosphere (()CMG) is suitable to prepare large single domains of bulk Ag composite materials based on 5mBa2Cu3()7 Recently, Nariki et al. [3J have grown large GdBa2Cus07/Gd2BaCu()s/Ag bulk materials of remarkably high quality. Trapped fields of 2. 1 T and 1. 8 T have been measured at 77 K in a distance of 1.2 mm from the surface of 65 mm and 48 mm diameter samples, respectively.In Section 1 of the paper, the compatibility of Ag/REI23 composites with seeding and processing will be reported and the interactions between seed and flux will be investigated for a 5mBaCuO/Ag composite material in different atmospheres .Near-net-shape processing and techniques _ to produce large quasi-single domain bulk materials is a need for power application of bulk materials. In Section 2, we present a modified method to use a YBaCuO/Ag composite as a solder to join large single grains grown by a multiseed method[9].YBaCuO/ Ag Composites Modified melt crystallization process applied to the experiments reported here with .r between 0 and o. 43 (0 and 16 wt % related to the weight of the Y123 phase). The precursor materials were mixed, ground and pressed in a uniaxial press. Sm123 single crystals were set on to the top face before heating in air to 1030 C. After a dwell time of 20 min, the sample was cooled to 1000 C, followed by the growth period with slow cooling (1 K • h -1) to 940C. After ramping down (30 K • h -1), the final oxygenation proceeds in pure oxygen at 380·C.Phase relationships in the YBaCuO/Ag system The thermodynamic approach has been revealed to be an appropriate guideline to grow highly oriented (RE)Ba2Cu307 based large grain superconductorsJ. Despite that our knowledge about the four component phase diagram YO!. 5-Ba()-CuOn-Ag is still incomplete, the sections in Fig. 1 can explain the relevant fea tures of the process. Figure 1 presents sections with (YI/6Ba2l6 CU3/607/6+k/6 Y 20 3+m/6 Y2BaCuOs) at the one end and Ag (e) at the other end which are based on quantitative thermoanalysis and microstructure investigations at o. 21 bar (1 bar = 105 Pa ) oxygen pressure[lZ.13]. Figure 1a shows the behavior of the Y123-Ag mixtures (k=nz=O).Note that the Y123 phase forms a solid solution YBaz (Cul-yAgy )J()7-0 (Y123ss). the composition of which does not belong to the section considered in Fig. 1a - l c. This solid solution is formed by a solid state reaction (ssr ) ,SST:YBa2Cu3()7+3y Ag+1. 5y O 2 ----YBa2(Cul-yAgy)307+3y CuO and it will also appear during ramping the green body to the process temperature. accompanied by small amounts of Cu(). The maximum Ag concentration in the subsolidus Y123ss was reported in Ref. [12J to be y=O. 02.The Y123ss phase, however, which grows from the yell. s-BaO-CuC)n-Ag system in the melt texturing process, contains less Ag (y=O. 016).The composition with the lowest melting point (870C) in YOl.s-BaO-Cu()n-Ag is the ternary eutecticsV! , the composition of which is 0.10 Ag-O. 0112 vo.i-o. 2588 BaO-O. 63 ceo.. whereas 7 = 944 C is the lowest temperature at which a melt in any YBa2Cu307-Ag mixture was observed. Note that this is 10K below the melting in air point of Ag the appearance of the metallic melt 1-4 conists mainly of Ag which should be attributed to a pseudo reaction e : YI23ss+CuO+Ag=I.....This reaction appears invariant with temperature at the considered section since the amount of CuO resulting from ssr does not exceed the solubility limit of CuO in the Ag rich melt L (see Fig. La) and can be considered as a degenerated variant of the invariant reaction U1 proceeding in the quaternary system Ul:Y123ss+CuO+Ag=L + L.At concentrations higher than 2. 5 mol ~~ Ag, the complete decomposition of Y123ss takes place at 980 C in a reaction of the monotectic type m (somewhere also called a monotecto-peritectic reaction as simultaneously proceeding monotectic and peritectic reactions [12J) m , YI23+1-4=211+I~.L and 1./ designate the YBa ZCu,j07 rich and the Ag rich compositions of the melt along the immiscibility line. respectively, according to Fig. la. The monotectic composition of 2. 5 mol~;£; is labeled by X m in this figure corresponding to 5 mol % Ag in the I~ liquid or 2. 6 wt % Ag 2( ) addition to YBa2Cu307. The section, Fig. 1b , in the multi-component phase diagram is relevant to a precursor composition, which is applied to the MMCP. Note that Y Z0 3reacts with a part of Y123 already in the subsolidus region to form Y211. Here, the solid solution YBa2 (Cu.c., Agy ) 30 7 does not extend to the shown section in the subsolidus region. This figure indicates the quasi-monotectic reaction m: Y123+I.,/=Y211 +I~ to appear already at 970 C in air, which causes Y123 to disappear at any Ag concentration larger than 5 mol%. Note that Y123 coexists with L between 1020C and 970C in air.The phase relationships get more complicated in the Ag rich part which, however, will influence only the crystallization of the residual melt in the sample.Figure Ic represents a precursor mixture of Y123 + Y2ll phase (k = 0, m = o. 6) which is applied to the experiments in Section 2, when a YBaZCu307!YzBaCuOs/Ag composite is used as a solder rnaterial. Growth and microstructure evolution in YBaCuO / Ag composites According to the phase equilibria, the precursors of practical relevance ha ve a hyper-monotectic composition. The hyper-rnonotectic precursor, first heated to the Y211 +L phase field (Fig. Ib ) and then slowly cooled down, remains in the supersaturated (undercooled ) state from which the solid solution can crystallize in the quasi-monotectic reaction m, leaving the residual melt L with a composition corresponding to T(m).On the basis of a quantitative microstructure analysis[13] , it was found that during the melt-growth of a Y123!211 single-grain sample from a starting composition YI23+0. 24Y z0 3+xAg, the monotectic-like crystallization has also occured in the case of hyper-rnonotectic compositions. After cooling down to the crystallization temperature, the supersaturated L liquid does not decompose in the entire sample volume. Instead, it decomposes only in the vicinity of the growth front. At a certain critical average concentration of Ag in the melt (for given solidification conditions), the concentration of Ag in the Ag diffusion zone reaches its critical value and L in the vicinity of the growth front becomes unstable. The estimated critical average concentration of Ag in L is 12.6mol% .. At a lower than critical average Ag concentration in the melt, the supersaturated L melt does not decompose, and therefore no Ag particles are trapped in the growing crystal. This phenomenon of supersaturation IS apparently Fig. 2 Measured volume content VAg and average diameter dAg of the Ag particles in the samples with 8 and 12 wt % AgzO addition. Optical micrographs in normal light (c)-(d)) taken from the a-growth sector of the sample with 8 wt% AgzO addition cut along the a-c plane. (c) The Ag particles at the start of trapping. (d) At the end of the low growth rate region CLGRR). (e) Elongated Ag particles aligned in the growth direction seen at the beginning of the high growth rate layer (HGRL). SM means solidified melt and SFR means silver free region. Further inhomogeneities come from the changing crystallization rates during the process, since trapping of inert particles (Ag droplets in our case) is supported by increasing drag forces, which responsible for the Ag-free region found near the seed in the samples with lower Ag addition than 12.6 mol% (Fig. 2).appear with higher solidification rates [13.14] • The observed pronounced alignment of elongated Ag particles into rows parallel to the growth direction at the higher growth rate (Fig. 2e). and the phenomenological analysis of the crystallization process[I3] proved that solidification of 123 with Ag addition can be counted as so-called B type monotectic crysta lliza tion[IS]. The composition of Ag particles was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy <EDX) to be	Ago.88±O. 02CUO. 02±O. 005 00.

Superconducting properties of YBaCuO/Ag Despite the significant content of Ag , the superconducting transition in the melt grown samples is sharp at T; = 92. 2 K, in contradiction to results for polycrystalline samples prepared at 900C[l6J. Trapped fields at 77 K have not been affected significantly by Ag in the samples which are 24 mm in diameter. The resistance against Lorentz forces, however, is increased, thus allowing us to trap 6. 7 T which was achieved at 40 K on top of a single disc without injurious cracking of the sample, and 11. 4 T if the superconductor was additionally armed with a ring of stainless steel (achieved at 17 K, see Fig. 3). A further increase has been achieved using the improved pinning behavior in a Y123 melt-textured material with o. 5 % eu atoms in YbalCu3()7 are substituted by Zn[17.18J. The improved pinning was also realized in YBaCuO/Ag composite materials doped with Zn. In this case, Fig. 3 indicates the trapped field of 12. 2 T on top of the single disc of YBaCu()/Ag : Zn, and cooling was necessary only Fig. 3 Trapped (remanent) field vs. temperature T in the gap of a mini-magnet from two YBaCuO cylinders (diameter 22 mm) , steel bandage applied[7]. to 22 K. A remanent field as high as 16 Twas measured at 24 K with the same material in the 2.5mm gap of a mini-magnet consisting of two cylindrical superconductors, 24 mm in diameterl, Improved mechanical behavior in YBaCuO! Ag composite material. It has been shown in a previous paper that both fracture toughness and strength (measured by bend tests) are increased by about 25 % in the melt-textured YBaCuOjAg composite material compared with normal melt-textured materials[ls]. This improvement is of the same order as observed in polycrystalline sintered ceramics and can hardly be believed to be the only reason for the remarkably increased reinforcement under the influence of the Lorentz force. Quantitative evaluation of microstructural images conveys a better understanding. The presence of pronounced macrocracks in the c-direction (perpendicular to(100) type alb-planes) has been observed in Ref. [19] on polished sections after etching besides the well-known alb-microcracks parallel to (100) planes (Fig. 4).Whereas the latter are accepted to appear due to the difference in thermal expansion (including oxygen uptake) of 123 and 211 phases[lO], the c-directed macrocracks appear during the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic <T /0) phase transformation. This can be concluded from Fig. 5 which shows the crack in the c-direction stopping at the boundary between oxidized (orthorhombic) and incompletely oxidized (still tetragonal) parts of the sample. Furthermore, Table 1 indicates the remarkably reduced density of cracks (especially parallel to c) in the YBaCuO/Ag composites compared with standard YBaCuO (see also Fig. 4).Table 1 Comparison of YBaCuO/Ag composites with standard YBaCuO. alb microcrack spacing, Aa-b-C; c-crack spacing, Ave; 211 particle size, d111 ; Ag particle size, dAi ; 211 volume percent, V211 ; and Ag volume percent, VAi; in the Ag free and Ag doped single-grain Y123 bulks. a is standard deviation.The reason why Ag addition suppresses cracking can be associated with micro-stresses introduced by Ag particles during cooling down from the processing temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient of the 123 phase is less in the alb-plane Fig. 4 Cracks are more dense in Ag free samples (a), (c) than in the sample with 12 wt % Ag (b), (d) . This is demonstrated for both alb-microcracks (upper line, a, b) and macrocracks paraJlell to c-axls (lower line c , d).. The density of macrocracks appearing parallel to c-axls is reduced in the YBaCuO/Ag composite (d) compared with the Ag free sample. Ag particles appear bright. Sections are polished and etched.Fig. 5 A c-crack stopping at the boundary between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases.and is higher in the c-axis than the thermal expansion coefficient of silver (Table 2). However, due to the very high plasticity of Ag (very low yielding stress), silver particles can be, in the first approximation, considered to be more like a liquid rather than a rigid solid. Then. the total volume change must be taken into account instead of the anisotropy of the thermal expansion coefficient, when estimating the micro-stresses induced by Ag particles. The volume change of aTypical value for oxides. * Including both thermal expansion and oxygen uptake.unit volume from the processing temperature (925 C) to room temperature (calculated using the thermal expansion coefficients shown in Table 2) is ~VAg == 8. 87 X 10-6 for Ag and ~V123/211 = 2.

A6 X 10- 6 for a composite of 123 + 21 vol % 211. If the Selsings[2l] formalism of stress estimation used in Ref. [18J is applied, we can write: Here,	Po is  the	hydrostatic	pressure  in	the	Ag particle, 0123/2118	(r)	and	0'123/2118	(r)	are	the tangential	stresses in	the	123/211	matrix,0123/211R(r) is the radial stress in the 1231211 matrix, RAg is the radius of the Ag particle, 11123/211 is the mean Poisson ratio (mean of the a, band c directions of the 123 phase), E 123/211 is the mean Young modulus of the 123/211 composite, K Ag is the bulk modulus of silver, R, () and e indicate components in spherical coordinates, and r is the distance from the center of the Ag particle. The signs of +0' and - (J signify tensile or compressive stress, respectively. 
The stresses a t the particle-matrix interface do not depend on the particle size. They decrease with RAg/r and are at 12.5% of the maximal value at r= 2R Ag• The tensile radial stress 0'123/211R (r) = 530 MPa and compressive stresses(J12~/2118(r) =  -  0 123/211flP  (r)   == 265  MPa  were estimated for the particle-matrix interface using values from Table 2. Consequently, Ag particles introduce completely different stress field into the matrix when compared with 211 particles. This stress field IS schematically shown in Fig. 6. 4 Conclusions The addition of silver to RE123 (RE=Y, Sm ) has been found to influence both properties and processing of melt-textured bulk (RE)BaCuO/Ag composite materials. The improved mechanical strength of YBaCuO / Ag composites permits a field as high as 16 T to be trapped at 24 K in the gap between two stacked cylindrical samples. The solidification of (RE)BaCu()/Ag composite materials proceeds in a quasi-monotectic instead of the peritectic reaction for pure (RE) BeCuf) materials. The quasi-monotectic temperatures for different RE123 (RE = Nd , Sm , or Gd ) compounds differ by about 15 K in air and by less than 10 K at p «()zX = 10-3 bar, resulting in a strong interaction with the seed, if RE123 is used as seed material. Therefore, hot seeding is unavoidable. It has been shown that 5mBaCuO/Ag can be prepared in air and its properties can be improved by a post-annealing under low oxygen partial pressure.Promising results concerning the welding of two independently grown large single grains prepared by the multi-seeded technique are presented. The key procedure consists in controlling the growth direction and using the thin layer cut from a YBaCuO/Ag melt-textured sample as a solder. Both microstructure analysis and the superconducting properties indicate that a good junction could be obtained. The spacer layer is composed of a single 123 grain with the same orientation as the two adjacent YBaCuO blocks. The superconducting properties in the joint can achieve the same quality as in the YBaCu() bulk samples and a high critical current can flow across the junction resulting in high trapped magnetic field.
