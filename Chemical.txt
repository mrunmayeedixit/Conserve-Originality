Abstract—This article proposes the idea of using Solar Energy (SE) as a source of power for designing and developing a stan-dalone air-cooling system. This type of application is particularly suited for rural areas that have a considerable amount of solar radiation and have no access to grid systems. The proposed system is comprised of a photovoltaic (PV) array, DC-DC boost converter and DC-DC buck converter. Two Permanent Magnet Brushless Direct Current (PMBLDC) motors are employed to drive a centrifugal water pump and an air blower coupled to their individual shafts. The air blower is connected with a DC-DC boost converter that ensures a maximum power point (MPP) operation. A centrifugal water pump is connected with a DC-DC buck converter. The challenging task in an air cooling system is to maintain the constant speed of the blower under variable irradiance conditions. The power provided by the solar PV array can be shared between the two DC-DC converters in such a way that the BLDC motor connected with the blower will maintain a constant speed by maintaining the constant voltage of the DC-DC boost converter. The rest of the available PV power will be handled by the pump. The suitability of the proposed system for various perturbations is evaluated by simulating the proposed system using a MATLAB/Simulink and is validated by conducting experiments. Case studies have been performed with a variable PV irradiance and the results are explored. INTRODUCTION THE rate of energy consumption is increasing very rapidly due to increases in population, industrialization, trans-portation, etc. and the energy supply is depleting due to the annihilation of fossil fuels, resulting in inflation and energy shortages. This paves the way for exploring other available renewable resources. Among all the renewables, solar is the most abundant and the effective harvest of this energy can easily fulfil t he p resent energy demands o f t he world [1]. Though the extraction of energy from the sun is a bit costly, the reduction in the cost of power electronic devices and Solar Panels in recent years along their increased lifetime [2] has increased the usage of solar photovoltaic (PV) based generation for various household and industrial applications. Although several researches have been carried out on PV array fed automotive and irrigation systems combining various DC-DC converters and motor drives [3]–[6], very little work has been done on PV based home appliances. Further, the applications of BLDC motors are expanding, as these motors are highly reliable, highly efficient, with low radio frequency interference, noise and high torque/inertia ratio with improved cooling, and require practically no maintenance [5], [6]. Due to these merits, a BLDC motor is considered to help develop a solar PV fed air cooler, which can operate satisfactorily for longer time periods as compared to brushed motors under dynamically changing atmospheric conditions. The Perturb & Observe (P&O) based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm [7] is used to control the DC-DC converter such that the solar PV system always operates at its MPP. The challenging issue in designing a solar air cooler as compared to solar pumps [4]–[6] is to maintain the constant speed of the motor that drives the air blower. In the process of maintaining the constant speed of the air blower, power imbalance occurs between the PV source and the load which otherwise leads to a continuous rise or fall in the DC capacitor voltage. To avoid this power imbalance and to manage DC voltage within limits, an additional BLDC motor is used which can be used to drive the pump load in the cooler. Two three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) are used to feed the BLDC motors driving the cooler mechanical loads. The inverters are operated at fundamental frequencies which are obtained from the motor running speed which reduces the switching losses in the inverter [6]. A hall sensor-based scheme is adopted to obtain the speed and position of the BLDC motor [8]. The electronic commutator provides the gate pulses to the inverter circuit and hence controls the pattern of the stator currents of the BLDC motor. An inner hysteresis current controller based speed controller scheme is adopted which controls the motor speed control and also limits the current flowing through the inverter and the BLDC motor which is used to drive the air blower. Further, an optimal power extraction from the SPV system is given in [12]–[14]. This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the configuration of the solar air cooler system. The designing procedure for individual components of the solar air cooler is illustrated in Section III. Section IV explains the control schematic used for both the BLDC motors along with the DC voltage control. The performance evaluation of the air cooler is described in Section V while being subjected to different perturbations. Section VI provides the experimental analysis and finally Section VII presents the conclusions of the paper. II. SOLAR AIR COOLER SYSTEM CONFIGURATION The existing [1] solar air cooler schematic is shown in Fig. 1 and the proposed system configuration is shown in Fig. 2 respectively. The input power is obtained by using a Solar PV panel connected in an array fashion, a DC-DC (boost) converter, along with a voltage source inverter (VSI) and two BLDC motors with an air blower and pump loads coupled to their shafts which are the basic building components of a solar air cooler. The BLDC motor has an inbuilt encoder which encodes the signal generated by the Hall sensors. These signals are sent to the electronic commutator which controls the gate pulses of the inverter feeding the BLDC accordingly. The detailed working operation of the proposed solar air cooler is explained in upcoming sections. motors converts the DC input power fed from the DC-DC converter to the AC power that powers up the BLDC motor to drive the centrifugal pump and the blower fan coupled to their respective shafts. The important drawbacks of the proposed converter [1] are, not being able to handle the power sharing properly in the variable irradiance/dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the use of two three phase inverters makes the system so bulky and causes a reduction in its efficiency. Hence, a modified solar air cooling system is proposed with a half bridge voltage source converter. To ensure that the speed of the blower is constant, a stiff voltage is maintained at the end of the boost converter. The detailed operation is provided in Section III. DESIGN OF SOLAR AIR COOLER SYSTEM For development of an efficient and effective air cooler system that is capable to operate under various uncertain conditions, designing of all the individual components is required. The detailed design of all the considered components such as, half wave VSI, boost converter, buck converter, BLDC motors driving the centrifugal pump and the air blower are described as follows. Design of PV Array with Boost Converter The proposed SPV array model is designed with two PV modules connected in series. Each PV module has the maximum power voltage (Vmp) 17.8 V and current (Imp) 5.7 A. The PV system is operated at MPPT with the help of the DC-DC converter which is connected across the PV array using the P&O algorithm [7]. The DC-DC converter components such as series inductance (Lse), input capacitor (Cpv) and the DC link capacitor (Cdc) are to be estimated. To reduce the stress on the components, the switch, and converter are always operated in a continuous conduction mode [9]. Therefore for the converter design procedure, the continuous conduction mode is assumed. For designing the parameters of the boost converter, the maximum switch current needs to be calculated for the min-imum input voltage. Therefore, the duty cycle for achieving the maximum switch current is: The characteristics of the connected PV panels are given in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). The PV panel characteristics are drawn with a constant temperature at 25 C; whereas the irradiance decreases, the output power decreases, which is shown in Fig. 3(a). Furthermore, as the same panels are exposed to various temperature conditions, the temperature increases, and the power delivery capability decreases as shown in Fig. 3(b). The shortcut current, open circuit voltage and maximum peak can be found in the same figures. Furthermore, the MPPT is obtained with the P&O algorithm and its flowchart is shown in Fig. 4. Perturb and observe is a linear technique used to track the maximum power point of a system source; in this method, the operating voltage value is regularly increased or decreased based on the direction w.r.t. current operating voltage location, in order to shift the voltage value towards the maximum power point voltage value. B. Design of BLDC-motors Two 3-phases, 4-pole BLDC motors were considered to drive both blower and pump loads. A second-order state-space model that produces a trapezoidal back EMF is used to represent the electrical and mechanical parts of the BLDC motor. The ratings of the BLDC that drives the blower is set to 0:15HP whereas the pump driving the BLDC motor rating is chosen based on the margin of solar irradiance up until when motors converts the DC input power fed from the DC-DC converter to the AC power that powers up the BLDC motor to drive the centrifugal pump and the blower fan coupled to their respective shafts. The important drawbacks of the proposed converter [1] are, not being able to handle the power sharing properly in the variable irradiance/dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the use of two three phase inverters makes the system so bulky and causes a reduction in its efficiency. Hence, a modified solar air cooling system is proposed with a half bridge voltage source converter. To ensure that the speed of the blower is constant, a stiff voltage is maintained at the end of the boost converter. The detailed operation is provided in Section III. DESIGN OF SOLAR AIR COOLER SYSTEM For development of an efficient and effective air cooler system that is capable to operate under various uncertain conditions, designing of all the individual components is required. The detailed design of all the considered components such as, half wave VSI, boost converter, buck converter, BLDC motors driving the centrifugal pump and the air blower are described as follows A. Design of PV Array with Boost Converter The proposed SPV array model is designed with two PV modules connected in series. Each PV module has the maximum power voltage (Vmp) 17.8 V and current (Imp) 5.7 A. The PV system is operated at MPPT with the help of the DC-DC converter which is connected across the PV array using the P&O algorithm [7]. The DC-DC converter components such as series inductance (Lse), input capacitor (Cpv) and the DC link capacitor (Cdc) are to be estimated. To reduce the stress on the components, the switch, and converter are always operated in a continuous conduction mode [9]. Therefore for the converter design procedure, the continuous conduction mode is assumed. For designing the parameters of the boost converter, the maximum switch current needs to be calculated for the min-imum input voltage. Therefore, the duty cycle for achieving the maximum switch current is: The characteristics of the connected PV panels are given in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). The PV panel characteristics are drawn with a constant temperature at 25 C; whereas the irradiance decreases, the output power decreases, which is shown in Fig. 3(a). Furthermore, as the same panels are exposed to various temperature conditions, the temperature increases, and the power delivery capability decreases as shown in Fig. 3(b). The shortcut current, open circuit voltage and maximum peak can be found in the same figures. A. Electronic Commutation Based Control Scheme The 120-degree switching logic is one of the most common strategies to control the six-step VSI. In this method, each phase will be conducted two times in one full cycle with a span of 120 electrical degrees each time. Therefore, to have a balanced operation of the BLDC, the hall sensors are spatially placed at 120 degrees apart [8]. Based on the Hall sensor signals, 6 switching pulses are generated as shown in Table III. Furthermore, the MPPT is obtained with the P&O algorithm and its flowchart is shown in Fig. 4. Perturb and observe is a linear technique used to track the maximum power point of a system source; in this method, the operating voltage value is regularly increased or decreased based on the direction w.r.t. current operating voltage location, in order to shift the voltage value towards the maximum power point voltage value. B. Design of BLDC-motors Two 3-phases, 4-pole BLDC motors were considered to drive both blower and pump loads. A second-order state-space model that produces a trapezoidal back EMF is used to represent the electrical and mechanical parts of the BLDC motor The ratings of the BLDC that drives the blower is set to 0:15HP whereas the pump driving the BLDC motor rating is chosen based on the margin of solar irradiance up until when the blower is expected to operate at constant speed. As both the BLDC’s are powered by the same PV source, whenever there is a reduction in solar irradiance, the power output of the PV system is also reduced. This causes the blower fan to deviate from its constant speed. During this period, the power supplied to the pump BLDC is curtailed and the maximum possible power is provided to the blower fan BLDC so as to maintain its speed. The proposed system with the BLDC configuration is shown in Fig. 5. C. Operation of Proposed Converter The proposed boost converter with a half bridge configura-tion is shown in Fig. 5. The converter can be obtained by the various switching mechanisms. The switch which is placed in the boost converter can boost the input voltage to the required operating quantity. Thus the obtained voltage is given to the proposed converter drive (air blower). The output voltage of the boost converter is maintained by the capacitor Cdc. Thus, the obtained voltage can be given to the three phases of the BLDC through S1, S2 and S3. When S1 is turned ON, the voltage will appear across the Phase-A, which enables it to move into the active region. Some sample modes of operation in conjunction with the boost converter are given in Table II. For the three phase, the combinational logic can be obtained as shown in Fig. 4. However, with the usage of a half bridge inverter, the combinational logic circuit will be half and the complexity decreases drastically, at least to half. For the proposed air blower, a fixed speed is obtained by using the hysteresis control method. It compares the reference speed with the original speed of the BLDC Motor and generates a torque reference which when divided by the machine torque constant ‘kT ’, gives the current reference magnitude. This current reference magnitude is multiplied with the hall signals generated back EMF (efabc) pattern to obtain the current reference (ifabc). These current references are then compared with the actual current flowing in the stator through which an error signal is obtained, which is passed through a hysteresis controller that provides the pulses to trigger VSI switches resulting in a desired speed for the air blower fan But an exact estimation of the losses is not easy to obtain, so we use the DC voltage control loop in addition to the MPPT control which is enabled when the reaches its threshold. Now, due to the DC-link voltage controller, the voltage across the capacitor is maintained but this causes the PV to operate below MPP. Therefore, less power is extracted but this is not a problem, as the mechanical load required to be driven is also reduced. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A 230 W solar air cooler model is designed as described in Section III. In this case, both the BLDC’s are considered to be of equal rating so that the air blower can be operated at a constant speed up to 500 W/m2 irradiance. In this scenario, the system behavior for the varying irradiance along with the initial dynamics of the BLDC motors are studied which is portrayed by Fig. 7. Initially the irradiance of the system is at 1000 W/m2 and the speed reference of the system is maintained constant at 1200 RPM during this case. the BLDC and the rest of the power is given to the BLDC. This is shown in Fig. 12(c). Furthermore, the boost converter voltage is reduced with the control, which in turn reduces the speed of the BLDC; however the system is maintained at the MPPT shown in Fig. 12(d). From the experimental analysis, it is clear that the system is maintained at the MPPT under variable irradiance conditions and delivers the power as per the requirements. A. Varibale Irridiance Condition The experimental system consists of two PV arrays, each with ratings of 100 W at 1000 W/m2 irradiance. These are connected in series with an open circuit voltage of 36 V. The fan blower is supplied with 90 V input DC voltage (which can vary up to 110 V DC) with a provided boost converter. The reason that the PV interconnection is needed for the boost converter is to enhance the speed horizon of the BLDC. This function of the boost converter is determined based on the MPPT algorithm. As the objective is to maintain the speed of the blower, the output voltage of the boost converter is maintained at constant and the speed is thereby maintained. The parameters of the pump and BLDC are provided in Table IV. VII. CONCLUSION A solar standalone air-cooling system using a pair of BLDC motors to drive the pump and air blower fan load coupled to their individual shafts is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and then verified by conducting an experiment. The maximum power point (MPP) operation of the photovoltaic (PV) array obtained with a DC-DC boost converter which is adjoined with the DC voltage control so as to ensure safe operation during light load conditions and the DC-DC buck converter ensures the proper operation of the pump. The speed of the air blower system is maintained constant with the help of the pump load, although there is variation in the solar irradiance. Furthermore, the speed controller is used to vary the speed of the air blower as per the user requirements and ensuring its ability to extract maximum possible power from the PV system.
